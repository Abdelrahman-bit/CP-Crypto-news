# Crypto News and Articles

A simple web application built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **EJS**, and **Axios** to display real-time cryptocurrency news and articles. This project pulls live data from cryptocurrency news APIs and presents it in a user-friendly interface using EJS templates.

## Features

- Display real-time cryptocurrency news and articles.
- Fetch data from cryptocurrency news APIs using Axios for HTTP requests.
- Use EJS for dynamic page rendering.
- Lightweight and fast with Express.js.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Express**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **EJS**: Templating engine to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)
- [API] (for more information about API key and documentation vist (https://rapidapi.com/NovusAPI/api/crypto-news16))

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdelrahman-bit/CP-Crypto-news
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd CP-Crypto-news
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application locally by executing:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   This will start the server on port `3000`. You can visit the app in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. The app will display the latest cryptocurrency news and articles fetched from external APIs.

## API Integration

This app uses **Axios** to make HTTP requests to various cryptocurrency news APIs (such as CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, or other sources). You can easily modify the API endpoints to add or change news sources.

Example Axios request to fetch news:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

app.get('/', async (req, res)=>{
    try {
        const magazine = await axios.get(URL, {
			headers: {
				'x-rapidapi-key': API_KEY,
				'x-rapidapi-host': "crypto-news16.p.rapidapi.com",
			}
		});
        console.log(magazine.data)
        res.render('index.ejs', {data: magazine.data});
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(`something went wrong: ${error}`)
    }
});
```

## Template Rendering with EJS

The project uses **EJS** for rendering dynamic HTML content. The app fetches the data from the API and passes it to EJS templates to display the information on the page.

Example of rendering dynamic content with EJS:

```javascript
res.render('index', { data: magazine.data });
```
